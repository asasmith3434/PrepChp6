    <h1> Norms and Exceptions</h1>

    <p> Cairo discusses in Chapter 6 the emphasis on the way data may be portrayed and therefore interpreted. One collection of data can reveil 
    different insights depending on the plot used, for instance, Violin plots and Strip plots give insights to different narratives.
    A Violin plot shows more specific details regarding the schools in Brazil where the outliers can be oberserved. Whereas, a Strip plot
    shows a broder visualization where the viewer can gain a quicker understanding and not become overwhelmed with the information.
    Furthermore, Cairo writes about how people may represent data using means, medians, and ect. Where the more explanation needed for 
    the data should be elaborated more on with ranges and outliers. If data corresponds evenly then a mean is all that is needed to 
    describe the data because it will encompass a true representation, and be an exception. However, if the data is heavily skewed by outliers 
    then a mean would not be accurate, and instead using the median would rear away from outliers. The median could give an unbiased number by showing the evenly distributed number. Ranges can also be used to go further in depth by providing the difference caused by a skew. In conclusion, the message
    being reveiled to the reader is that anyone looking for exploration into data and visualizations should comprehend all of these methods
    before coming to a conclusion and not look at one narrative causing a bias view.
